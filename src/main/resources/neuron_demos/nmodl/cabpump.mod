TITLE Calcium ion accumulation and diffusion with pump
: The internal coordinate system is set up in PROCEDURE coord_cadifus()
: and must be executed before computing the concentrations.
: The scale factors set up in this procedure do not have to be recomputed
: when diam or DFree are changed.
: The amount of calcium in an annulus is ca[i]*diam^2*vol[i] with
: ca[0] being the second order correct concentration at the exact edge
: and ca[NANN-1] being the concentration at the exact center

: Free internal calcium is in fast equilibrium with a non-saturable buffer.
: The ratio of bound to free is beta.

COMMENT
The combination of voltage independent current and calcium
accumulation is more difficult because care must be taken not to count
the pump current twice in the computation of the change ca[0].  Hence
the usage of last_ica_pmp to subtract the pump portion of the total
calcium current in ica so that its effect can be calculated implicitly
via the reaction "pumpca <-> pump + cao".  This artifice makes the
pumping much more stable than the assumption of constant pump current
during the step.  Otherwise, ca[0] is prone to become negative and that
crashes the simulation (especially the automatic computation of eca). 
Calcium currents that are inward are generally safe to compute in
separate models.
