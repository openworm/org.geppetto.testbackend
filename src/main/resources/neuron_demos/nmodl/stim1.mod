:this model is built-in to neuron with suffix stim
COMMENT
Note:
$NEURONHOME/nrnoc/SRC/stim.mod shows the correct current stimulus model.
The model here does not work correctly if the "extracellular" mechanism is also
inserted at the same location because the NONSPECIFIC_CURRENT is
 treated as a transmembrane current.
For electrodes, there is a special ELECTRODE_CURRENT directive in
the NEURON block that should be used. Also a positive ELECTRODE_CURRENT
is equivalent to an inward membrane current so the assignment to i has
a different sign.
